## Instructions

This project is my implementation of the Memory Game project for Udacity's Front-end Development course. 

### Game Instructions

To get started, open `index.html` and click on a card to begin the game. 

Click two cards to reveal if they match. Match all the cards to complete the game.

### Prerequisites

To fully experience this game you must have access to the following libraries:

* Bootstrap (4.6.1) for Font Awesome.
* Google Fonts (Coda)

### Player Performance

Player performance is rated on stars (all players begin with 3 stars):

3 stars - Less than 20 moves.
2 stars -  Over 20 moves but less than 30.
1 star - 30 and over.

There is also a timer recording the time taken (in seconds).
